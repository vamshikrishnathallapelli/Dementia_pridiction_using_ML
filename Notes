Modeling Process

14
Select models for the task: RandomForestRegressor, RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression.
Train each model using the fit() function on the scaled training data.
Model Selection and Training
Use trained models to predict the target variable on the test data.
For RandomForestRegressor: Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE).
For Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression: Calculate accuracy and generate a classification report.
Model 
Evaluation
Evaluate the results of each model.
Classify predicted values into categories (e.g., dementia, non-dementia, mild dementia).
Determine the best model based on evaluation metrics (MSE, accuracy, classification report).

Findings in 
Linear Regression
MSE of 0.0556 suggests a precise fit, aligning model 
predictions closely with actual values.
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
'Age' coefficient at -0.000692 indicates a slight negative correlation with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)
Coefficients Interpretation
Intercept at 5.1449 represents the 
predicted CDR when all features are zero.
Intercept Value
Negative coefficients for 'Educ', 'SES', 'MMSE', 'eTIV', 'nWBV', 'ASF' 
suggest potential shields against dementia.

Findings in Decision Tree Classifier 
77% accuracy in predicting dementia severity class 
showcases reliable performance
Model Accuracy
Challenges arise with low recalls, especially for "Mild Dementia" (14%) and none for "Moderate Dementia," revealing limitations in identifying these cases.
Recall Challenges
Class-specific precision (e.g., 0.93 for CDR=0) and recall (e.g., 0.83 for CDR=0) provide detailed insights into model efficacy.
Precision and Recall
Examining the support column reveals the actual occurrences of each class in the test set, providing additional context for model performance
