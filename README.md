Linear Regression:

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.
The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line through the data points that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values.
Linear regression is often used for tasks such as predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.
Multi Linear Regression:

Multi linear regression is an extension of linear regression to multiple independent variables.
Instead of just one independent variable, multi linear regression involves two or more independent variables.
The relationship between the dependent variable and each independent variable is assumed to be linear.
Multi linear regression is used when there are multiple factors influencing the dependent variable.
Decision Trees:

Decision trees are a supervised learning method used for both classification and regression tasks.
They partition the data into subsets based on the value of one feature at a time.
Each internal node of the tree represents a "decision" based on the value of a certain feature, leading to different branches (subsets) of the data.
Decision trees are constructed recursively by splitting the data into subsets until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum depth of the tree or a minimum number of samples in each leaf node.
Decision trees are popular due to their interpretability and ease of understanding, as the learned decision rules can be visualized as a tree structure.
Each of these techniques has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which to use depends on factors such as the nature of the data, the relationship between variables, and the goals of the analysis. Additionally, ensemble methods like Random Forests combine multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance.
